Spade
=====

Spade is a 2D arcade-style platformer made in Java 7. A robot trapped inside a factory must use a mysterious spade to escape. Use WASD to move and jump, and hit the arrow keys to either create or destroy blocks surrounding you (with a short cooldown).

I worked on it in the summer of 2012, and got the basic engine working along with a few levels. I purposely didn't use any game or graphics library because I wanted to do it myself. Looking back, I think I should have made only one, procedurally-generated, infinte level instead of multiple shorter ones, which are repetetive to play. But the spade mechanic is still fun to play with, and I'm happy with the way the game turned out. I learned a lot from working on it; the most important lesson I learned was to write readable code, since it was awful reading through this game's old messy code. If you are looking at this project for learning purposes, I strongly suggest looking somewhere else ;)

I used the NetBeans IDE, and [sfxr](http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html) for sound effects. I planned to use free music from [Newgrounds](http://www.newgrounds.com) but didn't get around to it. I also heavily used Notch's game [Prelude of the Chambered](https://github.com/skeeto/Prelude-of-the-Chambered) made for Ludum Dare 21 as a reference for grahpics stuff and handling level data, as well as lots of other things.
